Child Theme of JBST. With built-in Less Compiler and Masonry Grid layout. Based on jQuery Manasonry and Twitter's Bootstrap 3

== Description ==

[JBST](http://www.jbst.eu/) is a powerful theme framework that can be used as a standalone website builder or as a framework to create child themes for wordpress build on Twitter's Bootstrap 3. Full customizable with [Less](http://www.lesscss.org/). [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/) is a JavaScript grid layout library. It works by placing elements in optimal position based on available vertical space, sort of like a mason fitting stones in a wall. You've probably seen it in use all over the Internet.
